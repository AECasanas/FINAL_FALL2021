# FINAL_FALL2021

This is my final project for Fall 2021 FEWD class.  It is a project that I began a back a few years back
and building upon a framework purchsed from themeforest.

I have built this site previously not knowing what the framework in the background was responsible for and it
is a very exciting time being able to learn more about the complex workings of the site using the developer tools
as well as the concepts covered in class.

Challenges that remain:  The site was created a few years back and parts may be outdated.
The site framework remains large and I have not deleted unused items as either they may be useful in the future
or might mess up the site structure.  The site is responsive but some sections need to be better aligned.

The content of the site was originally a NYC travel site and some of that content still remains.
I will separate the sites into different niches in the future but for the purposes of the class, it works.

There was a document.write(Date) in the index but could not figure out how to remove the timestamp.
From my research it seems that it is not possible?

There is a line after the second logo div before the rated/starred lists which I cannot locate anywhere.

The background on the 'breaking news' section is black and I would prefer it to be transparent with only the 
background photo of the larger div which is a city picture showing.
